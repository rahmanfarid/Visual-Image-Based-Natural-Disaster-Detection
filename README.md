# Visual-Image-Based-Natural-Disaster-Detection
Every year, a significant number of fatalities occur worldwide due to natural disasters. Often, these tragic outcomes are a result of delayed assistance and rescue operations. Prompt identification of the disaster type can greatly expedite response efforts. Fortunately, contemporary technology enables rapid aerial imaging of vast regions. This project proposes harnessing such technology to develop a system capable of discerning the nature of a disaster from aerial images.

The project's foundation involves accumulating a diverse dataset, drawing from both online sources and potentially local data. Subsequently, a Python code incorporating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed. This CNN processes and analyzes the collected images. Upon preprocessing, the images are fed into the CNN model. The final stage entails testing the system's accuracy and performance. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize disaster response by expediting situational awareness and fostering timely interventions.
